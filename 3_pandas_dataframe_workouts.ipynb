    "\n",
    "These instructions will guide you on how to download the necessary data for the course using gdown in your JupyterHub environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a Terminal in JupyterHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In your JupyterHub interface, locate the \"File -> New\" menu \n",
    "\n",
    "* Click on the \"New\" menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Select \"Terminal\" from the dropdown options. This will open a new terminal window in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Navigate to the `data-with-python-exercises Directory`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the terminal, you'll start in your home directory. To navigate to the `data-with-python-exercises directory`, use the `cd` command (change directory):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd data-with-python-exercises\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Press the \"Enter\" key.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* The terminal should now show that you are in the data-with-python-exercises directory. You can confirm this by typing pwd (print working directory) and pressing Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Download the Data using gdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now that you are in the correct directory, use the following `gdown` command to download the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "gdown --folder --id 1cYN9ZPEjhWlEEwuTFbzT6p_ZYbnyk2_j\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Press the \"Enter\" key.\n",
    "\n",
    "* gdown will start downloading the data from the specified Google Drive folder. You will see output in the terminal indicating the progress of the download.  It will create a new folder inside the `data-with-python-exercises` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Verify the Download:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the download is complete, you can verify that the data has been downloaded successfully by listing the contents of the directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the files, use the `ls` command:\n",
