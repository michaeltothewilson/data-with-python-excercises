    "* `pd.Series.idxmax()`: Returns the index label of the first occurrence of the maximum value.\n",
    "* `series.index`: Returns the Index object of the Series. This object contains the labels for each of the elements in the Series.\n",
    "* `series.values`: Returns a NumPy array representing the data (the values) in the Series.\n",
    "* `series.loc`: Accesses a group of rows and columns by label(s) or a boolean array.\n",
    "* `series.iloc`: Accesses a group of rows and columns by integer position(s).\n",
    "* `series.round()`: Rounds each value in the Series to a specified number of decimal places.\n",
    "* `pd.read_csv()`: Reads data from a comma-separated values (CSV) file into a DataFrame.\n",
    "* `.squeeze()`: Converts a single-column DataFrame or a single-row DataFrame to a Series. When used with `pd.read_csv()`, it can directly return a Series if the data has only one column. \n",
    "* `str.split()`: A built-in Python string method that splits a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter. \n",
